# DataHub

DataHub is intended to be a central place for storing, processing, and sharing
data resources. The repository currently contains a skeleton structure that will
be expanded as the project evolves.

## Project structure

- `data/` – sample directory for datasets or data files.
- `src/` – source code for processing or managing datasets.
- `docs/` – project documentation.

Feel free to add additional modules or scripts as needed. More details will be
provided in subsequent instructions.
