# Overview

The DataHub provides a curated archive of cardiovascular omics datasets used in HeartBioPortal. Each dataset is stored in its own folder under `public/` or `private/` and includes metadata and provenance files that follow JSON schemas.

Use the navigation menu to learn how to submit new data and to browse the schema reference.

See [Processing Very Large Datasets](big_data_processing.md) for analysing VCF files exceeding 500 GB using Dask.
